                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-poppins font-bold mb-6 text-anchor-navy">Why Tradies Need Professional Websites in 2025</h2>
                    
                    <p class="text-lg mb-6">The trade industry across Hervey Bay, Maryborough, and the broader Fraser Coast region is more competitive than ever. While word-of-mouth referrals have traditionally driven business for electricians, plumbers, builders, and other tradies, today's customers are increasingly turning to Google to find reliable service providers.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-lg mb-8">A professional website isn't just a digital business card anymore – it's your 24/7 sales representative that can generate leads, showcase your work, and help customers book your services even when you're on the tools. When combined with effective <strong>SEO Hervey Bay</strong> strategies, your website becomes a powerful tool for attracting local customers searching for your services.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-poppins font-bold mb-6 text-anchor-navy">The Digital Transformation of Trade Services</h2>
                    
                    <p class="text-lg mb-4">Recent studies show that over 85% of customers research service providers online before making contact. This shift in customer behavior means tradies without a strong online presence are missing out on a significant portion of potential business.</p>
                    
                    <div class="bg-sand-beige p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
                        <h3 class="text-xl font-poppins font-bold mb-4 text-anchor-navy">Key Statistics for Tradies:</h3>
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">

                    <p class="text-lg mb-4">Not all websites are created equal. For tradies operating in areas like Hervey Bay, Maryborough, and across the Fraser Coast, certain features are crucial for converting visitors into paying customers:</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-poppins font-bold mb-4 text-anchor-navy">1. Mobile-First Design</h3>

                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                        <li>Click-to-call phone numbers prominently displayed</li>
                        <li>Service areas clearly listed (e.g., "Serving Hervey Bay, Maryborough, and Fraser Coast")</li>

                    <p class="text-lg mb-6">Before and after photos of your work, combined with genuine customer testimonials, build trust and demonstrate your expertise. Include projects from across your service areas to show local credibility.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-poppins font-bold mb-4 text-anchor-navy">4. Service Pages with Local SEO</h3>
                    <p class="text-lg mb-6">Dedicated pages for each service you offer, optimized for local searches. For example, "Emergency Plumbing Hervey Bay" or "Electrical Services Maryborough" help you rank for specific local queries.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-poppins font-bold mb-6 text-anchor-navy">How SEO Company Hervey Bay Services Boost Your Visibility</h2>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-poppins font-bold mb-6 text-anchor-navy">Digital Marketing Strategies That Work for Fraser Coast Tradies</h2>
                    
                    <p class="text-lg mb-4">Beyond basic SEO, a comprehensive digital marketing approach can help tradies across the Fraser Coast region build a steady pipeline of work:</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-poppins font-bold mb-4 text-anchor-navy">1. Social Media Presence</h3>
                    <p class="text-lg mb-4">Platforms like Facebook and Instagram are perfect for showcasing your work, sharing customer testimonials, and engaging with the local community. Post regular updates about projects, tips, and behind-the-scenes content.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-poppins font-bold mb-4 text-anchor-navy">2. Online Booking Systems</h3>
                    <p class="text-lg mb-4">Implement online booking functionality that allows customers to schedule services directly through your website. This convenience factor can be the difference between getting the job and losing it to a competitor.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-poppins font-bold mb-4 text-anchor-navy">3. Email Marketing</h3>
                    <p class="text-lg mb-6">Build a mailing list of past customers and send seasonal maintenance reminders, special offers, and helpful tips. This keeps you top-of-mind when they need services again or want to refer friends.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-poppins font-bold mb-6 text-anchor-navy">Choosing the Right Web Design Partner</h2>
